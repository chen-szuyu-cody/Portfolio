<h3>Overview</h3>
The challenge is to create a model that uses data from the first 24 hours of intensive care to predict patient survival. MIT's GOSSIS community initiative, with privacy certification from the Harvard Privacy Lab, has provided a dataset of more than 130,000 hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) visits from patients, spanning a one-year timeframe. This data is part of a growing global effort and consortium spanning Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Brazil, and more than 200 hospitals in the United States.

Labeled training data are provided for model development; you will then upload your predictions for unlabeled data to Kaggle and these predictions will be used to determine the public leaderboard rankings, as well as the final winners of the competition.

<h3>Data Description</h3>
- training_v2.csv - the training data. You should see 91,713 encounters represented here. Please view the WiDS Datathon 2020 Dictionary file for more information about the columns.
- unlabeled.csv - the data without hospital_death provided. You are being asked to predict the hospital_death variable for these encounters.
- samplesubmission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
- solution_template.csv - a list of all the rows (and encounters) that should be in your submissions
- WiDS Datathon 2020 Dictionary.csv - supplemental information about the data

<h3>Recommend to start from the following Notebook:</h3>

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
Our customers use visual media to inform, educate, and inspire purchasing decisions.  You recently launched an A/B test that showed when Rich Media (i.e. video, 3D imagery, and interactive content) is present on our Product Details Page (PDP), we see upwards of 7% conversion rate lift depending on the Product Class and content type (see Exhibit A & B for details).  The Wayfair Merchandising team is looking to capitalize on this opportunity by increasing Rich Media content across the catalog.  Not every product has this content as we rely on Suppliers to use our proprietary visual merchandising platform, called WayMore, to design a PDP layout that differentiates their products (see exhibit C below for an example).   

We have provided you with multiple datasets at the product class, Supplier, and SKU level that will help inform what Rich Media gaps exist (see Appendix for details on full dataset).

<h4>The Merchandising Analytics team (you) has been tasked with building a recommendation on one or more of the following topics:</h4>

- Supplier outreach strategy -- including Suppliers to target, prioritized SKU lists, etc.
- Opportunity size for filling Rich Media gaps
- Improve the customer experience through product content optimization
- Any other recommendations for Merchandising Leadership
